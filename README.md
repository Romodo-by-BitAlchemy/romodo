## Project Structure

This project follows a specific structure to ensure that the codebase remains clean and well-organized. Below is an overview of the main components, along with examples of what files could be included in each directory:

### `config/`

Contains configuration files such as database configurations, API keys, and environment-specific settings.

**TL;DR:** Store your app's configuration here.

**Examples:** `db.js` for database connection settings, `config.js` for API keys and other environment settings.

### `constants/`

Defines constants or enums used throughout the application.

**TL;DR:** Central place for all constants.

**Examples:** `responseCodes.js` for HTTP status codes, `roles.js` for user roles within the app.

### `controllers/`

Organizes route handlers and logic that handle HTTP requests.

**TL;DR:** Business logic for handling routes.

**Examples:** `userController.js` for user-related logic, `postController.js` for blog post interactions.

### `logs/`

Stores log files generated by the application for debugging and monitoring purposes.

**TL;DR:** Output logs here.

**Examples:** Automatically generated files like `access.log`, `error.log`.

### `middlewares/`

Implements middleware functions for tasks like authentication, input validation, and logging.

**TL;DR:** Reusable code that runs before your routes.

**Examples:** `authMiddleware.js` for checking user authentication, `errorHandler.js` for global error handling.

### `models/`

Defines data models that interact with the database and encapsulate data logic.

**TL;DR:** Schema definitions for your database.

**Examples:** `User.js` for the user model, `Post.js` for a blog post model.

### `public/`

Stores static assets like images, stylesheets, and client-side JavaScript files.

**TL;DR:** Publicly accessible files.

**Examples:** `logo.png`, `style.css`, client-side `app.js`.

### `scripts/`

Keeps utility or automation scripts here, aiding in the development workflow.

**TL;DR:** Scripts for tasks like database migration.

**Examples:** `backup.js` for database backups, `setup.js` for initial setup tasks.

### `routes/`

Defines API endpoints and links them to the appropriate controllers.

**TL;DR:** Route definitions for your API.

**Examples:** `userRoutes.js` for user-related endpoints, `postRoutes.js` for blog post routes.

### `test/`

Includes a dedicated folder for tests, covering various aspects of the application.

**TL;DR:** All your tests go here. Organize by feature or functionality.

**Examples:** `user.test.js` for testing user-related functionalities, `post.test.js` for blog post feature tests.

### `utils/`

Houses utility functions or modules used across the application.

**TL;DR:** Helper functions.

**Examples:** `logger.js` for custom logging functionality, `helpers.js` for commonly used helper functions like formatting dates or strings.

### `docker-compose.yaml`

Defines a multi-container Docker application, specifying services and dependencies.

**TL;DR:** Docker setup for running your app with services like databases.

**Example:** Defines services such as web app, database, and any other dependencies.

### `Dockerfile`

Builds a Docker container image for the application.

**TL;DR:** Instructions for building your app's Docker image.

**Example:** Contains steps for setting up the Node.js environment, installing dependencies, and starting the app.

### `package.json`

Manages project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

**TL;DR:** Project dependencies and scripts. Run scripts with `npm run <script>`.

**Example:** Defines scripts like `"start": "node server.js"` for starting the application, and lists all project dependencies.

### `Readme.md`

Documents the projectâ€™s purpose, setup instructions, usage, and other relevant details.

**TL;DR:** You're reading it! Everything about using and understanding the project.

### `server.js`

Creates the entry point of the application, setting up routes and starting the server.

**TL;DR:** Main file that starts your server.

**Example:** Initializes the express app, connects to the database, sets up middleware, and listens on a specified port.

### `.dockerignore`

Excludes files from Docker images.

**TL;DR:** Prevents unnecessary files from being included in Docker images.

**Example:** Might include `node_modules`, `.git`, `.env` files to reduce build context size.

### `.env` and `.sample.env`

Manages environment variables and provides sample values for newcomers.

**TL;DR:** `.env` for secrets, `.sample.env` to show required env vars.

**Example:** `.env` contains actual values for `DB_HOST`, `API_KEY`, etc., while `.sample.env` shows the needed variables without values.

### `.gitignore`

Specifies files and directories to exclude from version control.

**TL;DR:** List of files and directories Git should ignore.

**Example:** Typically includes `node_modules`, `.env`, log files, and possibly build directories like `dist`.
