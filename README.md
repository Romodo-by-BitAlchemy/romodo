## Project Structure

This project follows a specific structure to ensure that the codebase remains clean and well-organized. Below is an overview of the main components:

### `config/`

Contains configuration files such as database configurations, API keys, and environment-specific settings.

**TL;DR:** Store your app's configuration here. E.g., `db.js` for database connection.

**Usage Example:** `const dbConfig = require('./config/db');`

### `constants/`

Defines constants or enums used throughout the application.

**TL;DR:** Central place for all constants. E.g., `errorCodes.js`.

**Usage Example:** `const ERROR_CODES = require('./constants/errorCodes');`

### `controllers/`

Organizes route handlers and logic that handle HTTP requests.

**TL;DR:** Business logic for handling routes. E.g., `userController.js`.

**Usage Example:** In `routes/userRoutes.js`, use `const { createUser } = require('../controllers/userController');`

### `logs/`

Stores log files generated by the application for debugging and monitoring purposes.

**TL;DR:** Output logs here. Configure your logger to write to this directory.

### `middlewares/`

Implements middleware functions for tasks like authentication, input validation, and logging.

**TL;DR:** Reusable code that runs before your routes. E.g., `authMiddleware.js`.

**Usage Example:** `app.use('/api', authMiddleware);`

### `models/`

Defines data models that interact with the database and encapsulate data logic.

**TL;DR:** Schema definitions for your database. E.g., `User.js`.

**Usage Example:** `const User = require('./models/User');`

### `public/`

Stores static assets like images, stylesheets, and client-side JavaScript files.

**TL;DR:** Publicly accessible files. Place your static files here.

### `scripts/`

Keeps utility or automation scripts here, aiding in the development workflow.

**TL;DR:** Scripts for tasks like database migration. E.g., `migrate.js`.

### `routes/`

Defines API endpoints and links them to the appropriate controllers.

**TL;DR:** Route definitions for your API. E.g., `userRoutes.js`.

**Usage Example:** `const userRoutes = require('./routes/userRoutes'); app.use('/users', userRoutes);`

### `test/`

Includes a dedicated folder for tests, covering various aspects of the application.

**TL;DR:** All your tests go here. Organize by feature or functionality.

### `utils/`

Houses utility functions or modules used across the application.

**TL;DR:** Helper functions. E.g., `logger.js` for custom logging.

**Usage Example:** `const logger = require('./utils/logger');`

### `docker-compose.yaml`

Defines a multi-container Docker application, specifying services and dependencies.

**TL;DR:** Docker setup for running your app with services like databases.

### `Dockerfile`

Builds a Docker container image for the application.

**TL;DR:** Instructions for building your app's Docker image.

### `package.json`

Manages project metadata, dependencies, and scripts.

**TL;DR:** Project dependencies and scripts. Run scripts with `npm run <script>`.

### `Readme.md`

Documents the projectâ€™s purpose, setup instructions, usage, and other relevant details.

**TL;DR:** You're reading it! Everything about using and understanding the project.

### `server.js`

Creates the entry point of the application, setting up routes and starting the server.

**TL;DR:** Main file that starts your server. E.g., `node server.js`.

### `.dockerignore`

Excludes files from Docker images.

**TL;DR:** Prevents unnecessary files from being included in Docker images.

### `.env` and `.sample.env`

Manages environment variables and provides sample values for newcomers.

**TL;DR:** `.env` for secrets, `.sample.env` to show required env vars.

### `.gitignore`

Specifies files and directories to exclude from version control.

**TL;DR:** List of files and directories Git should ignore.
